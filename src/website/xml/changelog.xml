<revdescription>
<para>Fixed a small bug in the presentation of alternative parses when
there is ambiguity. Nonterminal symbols in the alternative choices did
not necessarily have the correct attributes.</para>

<listitem>
<para>CoffeeGrinder now carefully distinguishes between nonterminals
with different attributes. This introduces new nonterminals into
the grammar. These can be examined by calling
<methodname>resolveDuplicates</methodname> on the
<classname>SourceGrammar</classname>.</para>
<para>If, for example, you have two instances of a nonterminal
“B” in the grammar, where one has a mark attribute of “^” and the
other a mark attribute of “@”, after resolving duplicates there
will be two nonterminals in the grammar, “B” and “B₁”. They will
match the same inputs, but is now possible to distinguish between
them in the parse forest.</para>
<para>One particular use for this feature is the priority attribute
supported by CoffeeFilter. This attribute allows the grammar author
to associate priorities with nonterminals in ambiguous grammars to
guide the parse.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>All of the infrastructure associated with “pruning” nonterminals
that lead to ε has been removed. (It hasn’t actually be used for at
least a couple of releases.)
